# Django Backend Development Task

## Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a Django backend application. The main objective is to configure a Django project, manage environment variables securely, and connect to a database. The task is aimed at equipping you with the fundamental skills needed for backend development with Django, including working with sensitive information, database connections, and running a local development server.

## Task Objectives

1. **Project Setup**: Configure a new Django project and ensure it is ready for backend development.
   
2. **Environment Variable Management**: Use `django-environ` to securely manage environment variables, such as the secret key, database credentials, and debug settings, by loading them from a `.env` file.

3. **Database Configuration**: Connect the Django application to a database (such as PostgreSQL) using credentials stored in the environment variables.

4. **Run Migrations**: Apply database migrations to create necessary tables and set up the database schema.

5. **Admin Interface Access**: Enable the creation of a superuser to access Django's built-in admin interface.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following components:

- **Django Settings**: Configuration for environment variables, database, and application settings.
- **.env File**: A file that holds environment variables (e.g., secret key, database credentials).
- **Database Integration**: Connection setup between the Django app and the configured database.

## Summary

This project aims to establish the foundational setup of a Django backend application. It covers managing sensitive configurations securely, ensuring the application can connect to a database, and setting up the admin interface for managing data. 

This is a crucial starting point for any Django-based backend development and can be expanded with additional functionality, such as building APIs, handling user authentication, and more.
