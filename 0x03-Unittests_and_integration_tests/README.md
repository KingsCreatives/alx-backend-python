# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project covers how to write **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python using:
- `unittest` for test cases
- `parameterized` for parameterized tests
- `unittest.mock` for mocking external dependencies

## Learning objectives
- Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
- Learn how to use `patch`, `Mock`, and `PropertyMock`.
- Write parameterized tests.
- Apply memoization testing.
- Test code that interacts with external APIs (mocking `requests.get`).

All code is written in Python 3.7, follows **pycodestyle** (v2.5), and includes full docstrings + type annotations.
